1.) To perform input and output (I/O) on a text file in Python, you must first open the file. The built-in open function returns a file object:

file = open('somefile.txt', 'r')


2.) The following example example reads the file and computes the average score:

sum = 0
count = 0

with open('scores.txt', 'r') as scores_file:
    for line in scores_file:
        sum += int(line)
        count = count + 1

average_score = sum / count

print('The average score is', round(average_score, 1))

3.) The solution to the above.... "The average score is 81.5"

1.) given this file:

Thomas Jones 70
Marcus Hansen 68
Sarah Jenkins 63

2.) read input file and print height of each in feet and inches


with open('heights.txt', 'r') as heights_file:
    for line in heights_file:
        values = line.split()
        height_in_inches = int(values[2])
        feet, inches = divmod(height_in_inches, 12)
        print(values[0], values[1], 'is', feet, 'feet,', inches, 'inches tall.')


3.) The for loop reads each line of the file one at a time. For each line, the split method 
is used to separate the input line into a list of three separate values. 
The first and last names of the person end up in the first two elements 
of the list (values[0] and values[1]), and the height is in values[2].

Keep in mind that all of the input values are still strings. 
To process the height value as a number, it is converted from a string to an integer using the built-in int function.
